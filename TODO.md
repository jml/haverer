In addition to the many XXX, FIXME, and TODO comments scattered through the
code, the "Roadmap" outlined in the README, and the issues in the tracker,
there are still these other things that need to be done.

* Set up continuous integration on Github
* Generate and publish the documentation automatically
* Get help for how to have cleaner looking test modules (tests/Round.hs is
  quite messy)
* Clean up the visibility of names, too many things are currently exposed.
